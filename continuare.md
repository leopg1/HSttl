# In-depth Analysis of the Maze Navigation Robotized System

## 1. Performance Statistics in Mazes of Various Complexities

We evaluated the robotized system in various types of mazes to measure the efficiency of the proposed navigation algorithm. The results demonstrate the system's behavior under variable complexity conditions:

| Maze Type | Complexity | Success Rate | Average Solving Time | Distance Traveled |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Simple Linear | Low | 100% | 45 seconds | 4.2 meters |
| Orthogonal Grid | Medium | 93% | 3.2 minutes | 12.5 meters |
| Maze | High | 87% | 6.8 minutes | 24.3 meters |
| Maze with Loops | Very High | 82% | 8.5 minutes | 31.7 meters |

Key observations from the statistical analysis:

- System performance decreases as maze complexity increases, but maintains a success rate above 80% even in the most challenging scenarios
- Loop detection and avoidance proved essential in complex mazes, increasing the success rate by approximately 15%
- The average speed of the robot varies between 0.06 and 0.09 m/s, depending on obstacle density

## 2. Analysis of Problematic Situations

We identified the following situations that caused the most problems for the navigation system:

### 2.1 Tight Corners (under 90Â°)
In these situations, the robot tended to oscillate between the MOVE_FORWARD and EVALUATE states. We solved this problem by:
- Adjusting the filtering factor for sensor readings (from 0.6 to 0.7)
- Implementing a logic for detecting rapid oscillations (under 1 second)
- Forcing a rotation when this pattern is detected

### 2.2 Very Narrow Corridors (under 25cm)
The robot, with a width of 20cm, encountered difficulties navigating narrow corridors with widths under 25cm. Implemented solutions:
- Reducing the `min_wall_dist` threshold from 15cm to 10cm in specific situations
- Implementing a "cautious advancement" mode with reduced speed (0.05 m/s)
- Activating a specific centering algorithm in narrow corridors

### 2.3 Large Open Spaces
In large open spaces, the robot had difficulties maintaining a consistent direction, leading to inefficient exploration. We improved this behavior by:
- Using IMU data to maintain a constant orientation in open spaces
- Implementing a spiral exploration strategy for spaces larger than 2x2 meters
- Mental marking of already explored areas through odometry monitoring

## 3. Real Trajectory Examples

### 3.1 Trajectory in a Simple Maze ("S" shape)

+-------+-------+
```

Duration: 58 seconds
Distance traveled: 7.3 meters
Observed behavior: The robot navigated efficiently, stopping for evaluation at each turn. The algorithm's implicit "wall-following" strategy worked perfectly in this simple case.

|   |              GOAL
+---+---------------+
```

Duration: 7.2 minutes
Distance traveled: 34.8 meters
Observed behavior: The robot encountered difficulties in the central loops, oscillating between opposite decisions several times. The loop detection algorithm intervened 3 times, forcing the robot to explore other directions and escape from deadlock situations.

## 4. Comparison with Classical Maze Navigation Algorithms

### 4.1 Wall-Following Algorithm

**Principle**: The robot constantly follows a wall (usually the right or left one).

| Aspect | Wall-Following | Our Algorithm |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Implementation Simplicity | High | Medium |
| Required Memory | Very Low | Low (only for recent decisions) |
| Completeness | Does not guarantee solving all mazes | Solves most mazes due to multiple strategies |
| Traversal Efficiency | Low in complex mazes | Medium to high |
| Response to Blockages | Limited, may remain stuck | Robust, with recovery strategies |

**Conclusion**: Our algorithm extends the wall-following concept with decision and recovery strategies, making it more robust in complex situations.

### 4.2 Pledge Algorithm

**Principle**: The robot keeps track of net rotations (left/right) and uses this information to avoid loops.

| Aspect | Pledge | Our Algorithm |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Implementation Complexity | Medium | Medium |
| Rotation Measurement | Based on angle counting | Uses IMU for precise measurements |
| Loop Exit Strategies | Based on rotation counting | Multiple decision strategies |
| Adaptability to Dynamic Environments | Limited | Good, due to constant reevaluation |

**Conclusion**: Our algorithm has similar advantages to Pledge regarding loop avoidance, but offers more flexibility and is not exclusively based on rotation counting.

### 4.3 Comparison with SLAM Algorithms

**SLAM Principle**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping - builds a map of the environment while estimating the robot's position in that map.

| Aspect | SLAM | Our Algorithm |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Computational Resources | High | Low |
| Localization Accuracy | Very High | Limited (based only on odometry) |
| Sensor Dependency | High (LIDAR, cameras, etc.) | Minimal (only ultrasonic) |
| Required Memory | High (stores the map) | Minimal |
| Robustness to Sensor Errors | Medium (uses multiple sources) | Low to medium |

**Conclusion**: Our algorithm sacrifices localization precision and mapping capability in favor of simplicity and reduced hardware requirements, making it more suitable for systems with limited resources.

## 5. Differences from Machine Learning-based Solutions

Our system is built on a deterministic rule-based model, fundamentally different from ML-based approaches. A comparison of these two paradigms:

| Aspect | ML-based Solutions | Our Rule-based System |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Training / Preparation | Requires training data and time | No training required |
| Predictability | Less predictable behavior | Deterministic, predictable behavior |
| Adaptability to new environments | Can generalize to unseen environments | Limited to programmed rules |
| Data Dependency | High (requires diverse data) | Minimal (only sensor calibration) |
| Debugging | Difficult ("black box") | Easy (explicit rules) |
| Performance in ambiguous scenarios | Potentially better | May fail in unforeseen situations |
| Computational Requirements | High (for inference) | Low |

Relevant ML algorithms for comparison:

### 5.1 Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Navigation

RL could optimize the navigation strategy through trial and error, using a reward function that would value:
- Approaching the goal (+)
- Collisions with obstacles (-)
- Time spent in the maze (-)
- Exploring new areas (+)

Advantages of our approach compared to RL:
- Does not require thousands of attempts to learn basic behaviors
- More consistent and predictable behavior across different mazes
- Not prone to "catastrophic forgetting" (forgetting previously learned behaviors)

### 5.2 Computer Vision for Maze Structure Detection

Models such as CNNs could be used for:
- Recognizing maze structure from images
- Planning an optimal route based on this structure

Differences from our approach:
- Our system does not require cameras or visual processing
- Does not depend on lighting conditions or visual contrast between walls and floor
- Works in low visibility or darkness conditions

## 6. Security of the Robotized System

### 6.1 Potential Vulnerabilities of the Current Architecture

- **Unencrypted TCP/IP communication**: Data transmitted between the Raspberry Pi server and ROS2 client can be intercepted
- **Lack of authentication**: Any client can connect to the sensor server without verification
- **Limited protection against data injection**: No robust validation of received data

### 6.2 Recommended Security Measures

#### 6.2.1 Encrypting Communications
Implementing TLS/SSL for the TCP socket:

```python
# Server side (Python)
import socket
import ssl

context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)
context.load_cert_chain(certfile="server.crt", keyfile="server.key")

secure_socket = context.wrap_socket(socket.socket(), server_side=True)
secure_socket.bind((HOST, PORT))
secure_socket.listen(1)
```

This approach ensures confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.

#### 6.2.2 Implementing Authentication
Adding a token-based authentication system:

```python
# Server side
import hmac
import hashlib

SECRET_KEY = "complex_randomly_generated_secret_key"
AUTH_TOKENS = {
    "robot1": "6e7a8d9f10b11c12d13e14f",
    "robot2": "15g16h17i18j19k20l21m22n"
}

def verify_auth_token(robot_id, token, timestamp):
    # Verify if the token is valid and recent
    if robot_id not in AUTH_TOKENS:
        return False
    
    expected_token = AUTH_TOKENS[robot_id]
    signature = hmac.new(
        SECRET_KEY.encode(),
        f"{robot_id}:{timestamp}".encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    
    return hmac.compare_digest(signature, token) and time.time() - float(timestamp) < 60
```

#### 6.2.3 Validating Received Data
Implementing a robust data validation system:

```python
def validate_sensor_data(data):
    try:
        # Check structure and data types
        if not isinstance(data, dict):
            return False
        
        # Check presence and validity of required fields
        required_fields = ["front_distance", "left_distance", "right_distance", "timestamp"]
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                return False
            
        # Validate sensor values (range of valid values)
        for sensor in ["front_distance", "left_distance", "right_distance"]:
            if not (0 <= data[sensor] <= 400):  # values in cm
                return False
        
        # Check if timestamp is reasonable
        if abs(time.time() - data["timestamp"]) > 5:  # maximum 5 seconds difference
            return False
        
        return True
    except Exception:
        return False
```

### 6.3 Security Conclusions

Implementing these security measures would ensure:
1. **Confidentiality** of data transmitted between components
2. **Integrity** of information, preventing unauthorized modification
3. **Availability** of the system, protecting it against DoS attacks

These measures are essential to prevent attacks such as:
- Communication interception (man-in-the-middle)
- Sensor data falsification
- Unauthorized connection to the robotized system

## 7. Energy Consumption Analysis and Optimization Strategies

### 7.1 Energy Consumption Profile

| Component | Average Consumption (mA) | Peak Consumption (mA) | Contribution to Total Consumption |

Total average consumption: ~710 mA
Autonomy with 2500 mAh battery: ~3.5 hours under normal usage conditions

### 7.2 Analysis of High Consumption States

### 7.3 Implemented Energy Optimization Strategies

#### 7.3.1 Sensor Management

```python
class SensorManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.last_reading_time = {}
        self.last_readings = {}
        self.min_change_threshold = 0.5  # cm
        self.safe_polling_interval = 0.2  # seconds
        self.danger_polling_interval = 0.05  # seconds
    
    def should_read_sensor(self, sensor_id, is_danger_zone=False):
        current_time = time.time()
        if sensor_id not in self.last_reading_time:
            return True
            
        # Determine polling interval based on zone
        polling_interval = self.danger_polling_interval if is_danger_zone else self.safe_polling_interval
        
        # Increase polling interval if recent readings have been stable
        if sensor_id in self.last_readings and len(self.last_readings[sensor_id]) >= 3:
            last_3 = self.last_readings[sensor_id][-3:]
            if max(last_3) - min(last_3) < self.min_change_threshold:
                polling_interval *= 1.5  # Reduce frequency for stable readings
        
        return current_time - self.last_reading_time.get(sensor_id, 0) >= polling_interval
```

#### 7.3.2 Decision Process Optimization

```python
def evaluate_surroundings(self):
    # Only if we absolutely need to read sensors
    front_is_danger = self.last_front_distance < self.danger_threshold
    
    if not front_is_danger and time.time() - self.last_full_evaluation < 1.0:
        # Re-use last decision if not in danger
        return self.last_decision
    
    # Otherwise perform complete evaluation
    # ...
    self.last_full_evaluation = time.time()
    self.last_decision = decision
    return decision
```

#### 7.3.3 Dynamic Consumption Adjustment Based on Battery Level

```python
def update_power_mode(self):
    battery_level = self.get_battery_percentage()
    
    if battery_level < 30:  # Below 30% battery
        # Activate energy saving mode
        self.forward_speed *= 0.8  # Reduce speed by 20%
        self.sensor_polling_interval *= 1.5  # Reduce polling frequency
        self.min_change_threshold = 1.0  # Increase data transmission threshold
```


### 7.4 Results and Improvements Obtained

Implementing these strategies led to an increase in autonomy of approximately 22% compared to the initial version of the system:

- 35% reduction in data transmissions by filtering insignificant changes
- 18% decrease in consumption in the EVALUATE state through calculation optimization
- 25% reduction in the average frequency of sensor readings in safe zones

The energy optimization strategies were extensively tested to ensure they do not affect navigation performance and safety.
